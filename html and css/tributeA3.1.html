            ball, in a match India win by 11 runs.</li>
        <li>April 5, 2005: The first ODI hundred by an Indian wicketkeeper. After scores of 0, 12, 7* and 3, Dhoni is
            sent up the order to No 3 against Pakistan in Visakhapatnam and proceeds to smash 148 off 123 balls with 15
            fours and four sixes, setting the platform for India's 356/9. The world wakes up to Dhoni's potential.</li>

            Jaipur, helping India chase 301 with six wickets and 23 deliveries to spare. Batting at No 3, his 145-ball
            hundred makes a stiff target look well short and India go up 3-0 in the best-of-seven series.</li>
        <li>September 13, 2007: Dhoni's first international match in charge of India is a wash out against Scotland in

            Johannesburg. Dhoni is an overnight sensation once more and the landscape of T20 cricket is changed forever.
        <li> October 2, 2007: In the next match in Kochi, Dhoni scores his first fifty as captain - 58 off 88 balls - as
            India are beaten by 84 runs to fall behind 0-1 in the seven-match series.</li>
        <li> November 15, 2007: First ODI series win for Dhoni as captain, as India beat Pakistan by six wickets in

            256 is chased with six wickets in hand.
        <li>March 4, 2008: A momentous occasion for India as they win their first ODI series in Australia. The landmark

        <li>November 26, 2008: Dhoni's first 5-0 sweep of any team. Victory by six wickets in Cuttack whitewashes Kevin
            Pietersen's England.

        <li>March 11, 2009: Dhoni becomes the first Indian captain to win an ODI series in New Zealand. A whirlwind
            century from Virender Sehwag seals a ten-wicket win in Hamilton.
        </li>
        <li>February 24, 2010: India win a three-match series at home over South Africa, riding on Sachin Tendulkar's
            record-setting 200*. Dhoni injects 68 off 35 balls to a total of 401/3.
        </li>
        <li>April 2, 2011: India win the World Cup after 28 years, with the skipper hitting the winning runs with a six.
